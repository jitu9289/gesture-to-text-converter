The Project ” gesture to text converter ” is for those people who are either deaf or dump. gesture/sign language is a language through which communication is possible without the means of acoustic sounds. Instead , sign language relies on sign patterns, i.e., orientation and movements of the arm to facilitate understanding between people. This project is an portable Glove Based Sign Language Translator with LCD Display with flex sensor are used to sense the movement of fingers and gives corresponding input to an microcontroller

Projects consist of:

Arduino nano baord(AtMega328 microcontroller )
LCD
LED
BUZZER
Connecting wires
Gloves
flex sensors (alteranate: small toggle switches)
